[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-4-orange.svg)](#contributors)
Front-end web application built as part of project 2 in COMP90024 Cluster and Cloud Computing.

The application is built using Next.js.

Tweets were scraped using the Twitter API and sentiment was extracted using Python. Economic data was obtained from AURIN, whilst COVID-19 data was retrieved from [CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 "COVID-19 Data by CSSE at John Hopkins University") at John Hopkins University.

The application uses `mapbox` and `Chart.js` to do the heavy lifting.
